### Assumptions

* `pageDirectory` has files named 1, 2, 3, ..., without gaps.
* The content of files in `pageDirectory` follow the format as defined in the specs; thus your code (to read the files) need not have extensive error checking.
* The content of the file named by `indexFilename` follows our [Index file format]({{site.labs}}/lab5/REQUIREMENTS.html#index-file-format); thus your code (to recreate an index structure by reading a file) need not have extensive error checking.
