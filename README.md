This repository contains the Tiny Search Engine, built with a crawler, an indexer, and a querier. Please look at the README.md in each subdirectory for more information about each.

This project was built as one of the culminating experiences for CS50: Software Development and Implementation. It is a search engine developed in C that utilizes a crawler that crawls a span of webpages, an indexer that converts the webpage output to numerical rankings, and a querier that queries the rankings to find the URLs that best match any given query.
